0	To be or not to be, that is the question;
42	Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
84	The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
129	Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
172	And by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep;
217	No more; and by a sleep to say we end
255	The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
302	That flesh is heir to ? 'tis a consummation
346	Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
387	To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub,
438	For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
487	When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
531	Must give us pause. There's the respect
571	That makes calamity of so long life,
608	For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
657	Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
706	The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
751	The insolence of office, and the spurns
791	That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
832	When he himself might his quietus make
871	With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
915	To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
954	But that the dread of something after death,
999	The undiscovered country from whose bourn
1041	No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
1081	And makes us rather bear those ills we have
1125	Than fly to others that we know not of?
1165	Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
1210	And thus the native hue of resolution
1248	Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
1296	And enterprises of great pitch and moment
1338	With this regard their currents turn awry,
1381	And lose the name of action.
